# Simple Web Server

This is simple web server developed as part of my journey through Rust.

## Requirements

The following will need to be installed on your machine:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Cargo](https://crates.io/)

## Usage

```shell
cargo run main.rs
```

This code will listen at the local address `127.0.0.1:7878` for incoming TCP streams.
